I. Selected Software Architecture Style

Chosen Architecture: Layered Architecture

A. Justification Based on Granularity 

Why the System Falls Under Layered Architecture

The “Automated CI/CD Pipeline with Intelligent Failure Recovery” is structured into well-defined logical layers. Each layer performs a specific responsibility and interacts only with adjacent layers.

Granularity of Software Components

The system is divided into the following coarse-grained layers:

1. Presentation Layer
	•	Admin Dashboard
	•	Pipeline Status Display
	•	Report Viewer

2. Application / Business Logic Layer
	•	CICDPipeline
	•	BuildManager
	•	TestManager
	•	DeploymentManager
	•	FailureAnalyzer
	•	RecoveryManager
	•	ReportGenerator

3. Integration Layer
	•	VersionControlSystem (Git Integration)
	•	Deployment Platform Interface
	•	Notification Service

4. Data Layer
	•	Source Code Repository
	•	Build Artifacts Storage
	•	Test Reports Database
	•	Failure Logs Database
	•	Pipeline History Storage

Structural Characteristics
	•	Clear separation of concerns
	•	Business logic isolated from UI
	•	Failure recovery encapsulated in service layer
	•	Each layer communicates only with adjacent layers

B. Why Layered Architecture is the Best Choice 

1. Scalability
	•	Supports multiple concurrent pipelines
	•	New modules can be added without affecting other layers
	•	Failure analysis and recovery can be enhanced independently

2. Maintainability
	•	Independent modules for build, test, deployment, and recovery
	•	Easy debugging due to modular separation
	•	Code changes in one layer do not heavily impact others

3. Performance
	•	Lightweight interaction between layers
	•	Efficient execution flow from build to deployment
	•	Immediate recovery initiation after failure detection

4. Reliability
	•	Dedicated failure detection and recovery modules
	•	Reduced Mean Time To Recovery (MTTR)
	•	Controlled rollback mechanism

5. Security
	•	Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) handled at presentation layer
	•	Secure integration with Git and deployment platforms

Conclusion for Part I

Layered Architecture best fits this project because it provides structured separation, supports intelligent failure recovery, improves maintainability, enhances scalability, and satisfies both functional and non-functional requirements defined in the SRS.
