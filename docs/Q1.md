# I. Selected Software Architecture Style

## Chosen Architecture: **Layered Architecture**

---

## A. Justification Based on Granularity

### Why the System Falls Under Layered Architecture

The "Automated CI/CD Pipeline with Intelligent Failure Recovery" is structured into well-defined logical layers. Each layer performs a specific responsibility and interacts only with adjacent layers.

### Granularity of Software Components

The system is divided into the following coarse-grained layers:

### 1. Presentation Layer
- Admin Dashboard  
- Pipeline Status Display  
- Report Viewer  

### 2. Application / Business Logic Layer
- CICDPipeline  
- BuildManager  
- TestManager  
- DeploymentManager  
- FailureAnalyzer  
- RecoveryManager  
- ReportGenerator  

### 3. Integration Layer
- VersionControlSystem (Git Integration)  
- Deployment Platform Interface  
- Notification Service  

### 4. Data Layer
- Source Code Repository  
- Build Artifacts Storage  
- Test Reports Database  
- Failure Logs Database  
- Pipeline History Storage  

### Structural Characteristics
- Clear separation of concerns  
- Business logic isolated from UI  
- Failure recovery encapsulated in service layer  
- Each layer communicates only with adjacent layers

## B. Why Layered Architecture is the Best Choice

### 1. Scalability
- Supports multiple concurrent pipelines  
- New modules can be added without affecting other layers  
- Failure analysis and recovery can be enhanced independently  

### 2. Maintainability
- Independent modules for build, test, deployment, and recovery  
- Easy debugging due to modular separation  
- Code changes in one layer do not heavily impact others  

### 3. Performance
- Lightweight interaction between layers  
- Efficient execution flow from build to deployment  
- Immediate recovery initiation after failure detection  

### 4. Reliability
- Dedicated failure detection and recovery modules  
- Reduced Mean Time To Recovery (MTTR)  
- Controlled rollback mechanism  

### 5. Security
- Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) handled at presentation layer  
- Secure integration with Git and deployment platforms  

### Conclusion for Part I

Layered Architecture best fits this project because it provides structured separation, supports intelligent failure recovery, improves maintainability, enhances scalability, and satisfies both functional and non-functional requirements defined in the SRS.

# II. Application Components

## Core Components

### 1. CICDPipeline
- Controls overall pipeline execution  
- Maintains pipeline status  

### 2. BuildManager
- Fetches source code  
- Builds application  
- Generates artifacts  

### 3. TestManager
- Executes automated test cases  
- Stores test results  

### 4. DeploymentManager
- Deploys application  
- Performs rollback operations  

### 5. FailureAnalyzer
- Detects failures  
- Analyzes error logs  
- Classifies failure types  

### 6. RecoveryManager
- Retries failed stages  
- Executes rollback actions  

### 7. ReportGenerator
- Generates pipeline performance reports  
- Maintains historical data

## External Components

### 8. Developer
- Commits code  
- Triggers pipeline execution  

### 9. Admin
- Monitors pipeline  
- Views reports  

### 10. VersionControlSystem (Git)
- Stores source code  
- Sends webhook triggers  

### 11. Deployment Platform
- Hosts deployed applications

## Data Components
- Source Code Repository  
- Build Artifacts Storage  
- Test Reports Database  
- Failure Logs Database  
- Pipeline History Storage

## Final Summary

The CI/CD system follows a Layered Architecture where presentation, business logic, integration, and data layers are clearly separated. This architecture enhances scalability, maintainability, reliability, and supports intelligent automated failure recovery as defined in the project SRS.
