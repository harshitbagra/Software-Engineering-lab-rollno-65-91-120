# CI/CD System – Architecture Overview

## II. Application Components

---

## Core Components

### 1. CICDPipeline
- Controls overall pipeline execution  
- Maintains pipeline status  

### 2. BuildManager
- Fetches source code  
- Builds application  
- Generates artifacts  

### 3. TestManager
- Executes automated test cases  
- Stores test results  

### 4. DeploymentManager
- Deploys application  
- Performs rollback operations  

### 5. FailureAnalyzer
- Detects failures  
- Analyzes error logs  
- Classifies failure types  

### 6. RecoveryManager
- Retries failed stages  
- Executes rollback actions  

### 7. ReportGenerator
- Generates pipeline performance reports  
- Maintains historical data  

---

## External Components

### 8. Developer
- Commits code  
- Triggers pipeline execution  

### 9. Admin
- Monitors pipeline  
- Views reports  

### 10. VersionControlSystem (Git)
- Stores source code  
- Sends webhook triggers  

### 11. Deployment Platform
- Hosts deployed applications  

---

## Data Components

- Source Code Repository  
- Build Artifacts Storage  
- Test Reports Database  
- Failure Logs Database  
- Pipeline History Storage

# Architecture Style

The CI/CD system follows a **Layered Architecture** where:

- Presentation Layer → Developer & Admin Interface  
- Business Logic Layer → Pipeline, Build, Test, Deployment, Recovery  
- Integration Layer → Git & Deployment Platform Integration  
- Data Layer → Databases & Storage Systems  

---

## Final Summary

This layered architecture ensures:

- Scalability  
- Maintainability  
- Reliability  
- Clear separation of concerns  
- Intelligent automated failure recovery  

The design strictly follows the requirements defined in the Software Requirement Specification (SRS).
